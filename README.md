==============

QuickTrelloAdd, as its name implies, is a way to quickly add tasks to Trello.

It is built on top of Trello.NET with WPF.
There are two main uses:
* From tray icon, where you can select your "default" board to add tasks to.
* From keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+KeypadPlus)

The task will always be put on the bottom of first list of selected board.
