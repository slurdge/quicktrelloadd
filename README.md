QuickTrelloAdd
==============

QuickTrelloAdd, as its name implies, is a way to quickly add tasks to Trello.
You can see it a simpler way to use Trello on Windows without requiring a browser window open.

You can download the [latest release (setup.msi)](https://github.com/slurdge/quicktrelloadd/releases/latest/)

You can see it in action in the following screenshot

It is built on top of Trello.NET with WPF.
There are two main uses:
* From tray icon, where you can select your "default" board to add tasks to.
* From keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+KeypadPlus)

The task will always be put on the bottom of first list of selected board.

If you build this solution, you will need to put your API_KEY in the resource section

Pull requests are welcome.

Particulary, if you know your ways around WPF, the tags buttons need rework.
